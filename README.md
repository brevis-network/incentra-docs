Welcome to Incentra - a reliable, secure, and verifiable incentive distribution platform for DeFi protocols powered by [Brevis zkCoprocessor](https://coprocessor-docs.brevis.network/). Incentra is designed to connect protocols with liquidity providers and individual users, and to incentivize liquidity provision, token holding and many other interactions with the protocols. It may help to achieve massive success in increasing the TVL and other forms of user proactivity and engagement with the protocols.
