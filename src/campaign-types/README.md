# Campaign Types

Incentra is designed to be flexible and adaptable across a wide range of incentive models, including:

* [Token holding campaigns](token-holding-campaigns.md) — token holders are rewarded based on the time-weighted average (TWA) balance of an ERC-20 token.
* [Concentrated liquidity campaigns](concentrated-liquidity-campaigns.md) — liquidity providers (LPs) are rewarded based on the fees they earn on the Concentrated Liquidity AMM DEXes.
* [Lend and borrow campaigns](lend-and-borrow-campaigns.md) — users are rewarded for lending to or borrowing from a protocol.

Incentra also plans to expand into additional use cases that may be available in future phases. Feel free to contact us if you would like to create a different type of campaign or customize one to fit your specific needs.
