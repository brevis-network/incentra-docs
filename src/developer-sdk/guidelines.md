Incentra provides off-chain and on-chain APIs to fetch campaign data and let users claim their rewards. Incentive distributors can leverage these APIs to integrate Incentra with their own frontend UI to provide a seamless reward experience for users.

Specifically, the following APIs are available:&#x20;

* [Get Campaign](get-campaigns/): APIs for retrieve campaigns details by different criteria (e.g., by chain, by protocol, by campaign ID, by user).
* [Read and Claim Rewards](read-and-claim-rewards.md): on-chain interfaces for fetching and claiming a user's claimable rewards.&#x20;
* [Get User Leaderboard](get-user-leaderboard.md): APIs for retrieving all users and their cumulative rewards by campaign ID.
