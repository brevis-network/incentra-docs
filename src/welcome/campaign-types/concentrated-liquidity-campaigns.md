# Concentrated Liquidity Campaigns

For a concentrated liquidity farming campaign on Incentra, liquidity providers (LPs) earn rewards proportional to the fees generated by their positions in the pool of a Concentrated Liquidity AMM DEX such as Uniswap v3.&#x20;

Brevis retrieves the position data directly from the blockchain and periodically updates the reward data for all LPs. Brevis calculates individual reward distributions and then generates zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to validate the correctness of these calculations. These proofs are then verified on-chain to distribute rewards to LPs accordingly.

Incentra also supports Active Liquidity Management (ALM) protocols, allowing liquidity to be provided to the incentivized pool via ALM while earning rewards. For supported ALM protocols, Incentra automatically distributes rewards to their depositors based on their proportional share of the ALM vault (represented by the vault LP tokens), ensuring a seamless and efficient reward allocation process without requiring any additional user actions. In the initial scope, the following ALM protocols are supported.

* [Beefy](https://beefy.com/)

Note that only a selected list of whitelisted rewards tokens and pool tokens are supported on Incentra. Please contact us if you’d like to whitelist a token that isn’t currently available.
