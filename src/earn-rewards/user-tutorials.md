### Dashboard

On the Dashboard page, you can view your claimable rewards and see all campaigns you’ve participated in—whether still active or ended with unclaimed rewards. Please note that rewards can be claimed anytime within **180 days** after a campaign ends.

You can either click the ‘Claim All’ button to collect all rewards on the same chain in one single transaction, or click the ‘Claim’ button next to each campaign to claim them individually.
